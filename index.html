        Commercial founder turned Venture Scientist. With 15+ years across engineering, deep tech, and startups, I've founded two companies, raised from Notion Capital,

          <p>
            I'm currently a candidate in the Venture Science Doctorate (VSD) at Deep Science Ventures — 
            a fully-funded, 3-year programme that integrates scientific research with venture creation in 
            climate, pharma, agriculture, and computation. I was selected as one of 5 candidates 
            from over 600 applicants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a traditional PhD, the VSD is designed from the start to produce a company. Candidates 
            map a sector from first principles, develop and validate research hypotheses, and graduate 
            as co-founders with IP transferred into a new venture — ready for investment from DSV's 400+ 
            co-investor network.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background in GTM, products, and B2B sales is rare in deep tech. My role is to do both 
            jobs well: invent a genuine scientific breakthrough, then be the commercial engine that 
            takes it to market at the speed it deserves.
